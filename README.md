# Wheelspin

My first web based project!

A really old project I wrote in plain JS + HTML + CSS before I knew about GitHub, frameworks or libraries. Forza Horizon 4 inspired!

**Details**
- Just plain html files with javascript 
- Different css files for different screen widths
- Uses LocalStorage to store user data.


**Features**
- Random spinning wheel
- User gets spins each hour
- Cars collected in the garage can be sold

**Screenshots**

Home - Spinnning picks a random car after a short "animation".
